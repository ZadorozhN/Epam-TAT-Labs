Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun on they run through the endless grey
On they fight for the right
Yes but who's to say?
For a hill men would kill. Why? they do not know
Stiffened wounds test there pride
Men of five still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from this pain that they surely know
